# 12. Why HR does not assess people, but structures

## Purpose
- Dismantle CV-, title-, and potential-centric HR thinking.
- Show why activity reveals competence better than pre-assessment.
- Move HR’s role from evaluator to structure maintainer.
- Connect HR to the feedback loop.

## Core Claims
- HR’s task is to maintain the evaluation structure, not to evaluate people.
- Structural bias emerges when evaluation is based on status.
- Gatekeeper bias weakens signal in recruiting and internal mobility.
- The HR feedback loop reduces recruitment risk.

## Definitions (Operational)
- **Structural bias:** A systematic evaluation error produced by the structure.
- **Gatekeeper bias:** A situation where access to decisions depends on status, not signal.
- **HR feedback loop:** Ordered feedback between a recruitment decision and real impact.
- **HR structure:** Processes and roles that maintain evaluation consistency.

## Model / Mechanism
When HR maintains the evaluation structure, decisions are made based on signal → impact grows → structural learning happens. If HR acts as a gatekeeper, decisions rest on assumptions → impact weakens → corrective loops grow. The feedback loop connects recruitment decisions to real impact.

## Failure Modes
- HR focuses on culture-fit assessments without impact data.
- Recruiting turns into a slow approval chain.
- Feedback is collected but not used to change the structure.
- Partial application: FreeMarket is in use, but HR still assesses “potential.”

## Implementation Notes
- Start here: define HR roles by decision type.
- Build evaluation to be activity-based.
- Create the feedback loop: recruitment → impact → structural change.
- Measure structural bias (e.g., false rejections).
- Link HR metrics to the MaxROI core metrics.
- Avoid this: add interview rounds without new signal.
