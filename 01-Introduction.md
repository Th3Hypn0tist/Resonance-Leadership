# 01. Introduction: Why the world no longer obeys leadership

## Purpose
- Frame the current leadership crisis as structural, not a people issue.
- Show why hierarchy, charisma, KPI steering, and SaaS optimization do not produce lasting impact.
- Define the problem: the separation of steering and reality.
- Create the starting point for the Resonance Leadership model.

## Core Claims
- When decision authority and feedback separate, steering weakens measurably.
- KPI measurement easily produces the apparent-efficiency phenomenon if the metric does not track real impact.
- Hierarchy increases delay between decisions and consequences.
- Structural load shows up as constant reacting and corrective work.
- Leadership quality is a system property, not an individual trait.

## Definitions (Operational)
- **Structural load:** Repeated correction cycles that arise from structural gaps rather than a changing environment.
- **Apparent efficiency:** Measured efficiency improves even as real impact deteriorates.
- **Separation of steering and reality:** Decisions are made without up-to-date feedback on impacts.
- **Resonance Leadership:** A leadership model where structure and decision-making are tuned in sync with feedback.

## Model / Mechanism
Leadership fails when decisions happen far from impact. If decision-making moves away from feedback, steering is based on assumptions → assumptions age → work turns into corrective moves. If the structure keeps decision authority close to impact, the feedback loop shortens → decisions hit better → corrective moves decrease.

## Failure Modes
- The problem is explained as a people issue (“bad leader”), leaving the structure unchanged.
- Efficiency is interpreted as activity rather than impact.
- Decisions are centralized “for clarity,” increasing delay.
- Partial application: metrics improve, but decision authority stays far away.

## Implementation Notes
- Start here: map where decisions are made vs. where impact occurs.
- Identify metrics that do not track the MaxROI core metrics.
- Separate workload from impact in every report.
- Measure decision delay (decision → observed impact).
- Record correction cycles and their causes as structural, not personal.
- Avoid this: add hierarchy “for clarity” without shortening the feedback loop.
