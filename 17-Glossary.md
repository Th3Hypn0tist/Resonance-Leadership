# 17. Glossary — Operational definitions

## Purpose
- Lock terms unambiguously.
- Prevent metaphorical and moral interpretation.
- Enable applying the model without the author present.
- Serve as a reference and checkpoint.

## Core Claims
- An operational definition is observable in action.
- One term = one decision use.
- The glossary is the primary interpretation source for all chapters.
- If application fails, checking starts with the glossary.

## Definitions (Operational)
- **Resonance:** A situation where input and feedback are in rhythm and impact amplifies.
- **Resonance Leadership:** A leadership model where structure and decision-making are tuned to the feedback loop.
- **Structure:** The explicit order of decision authority, responsibility, and feedback.
- **SXaS (Structure as a Service):** Structure as a service with Ownership and Exitability.
- **Decision-making:** A steering moment that measurably changes the system’s state.
- **Service Leadership:** A leadership model where the leader removes decision obstacles.
- **MaxROI (Maximum Return on Intelligence):** An impact framework measured by three core metrics.
- **Money impact:** Net monetary impact resulting from a decision.
- **Environmental impact:** Net change in environmental impact resulting from a decision.
- **Well-being impact:** Net change in well-being resulting from a decision.
- **AIGM (AI Governance Model):** A role-based responsibility and decision model without hierarchy.
- **Responsibility:** Accountability for decision consequences, coupled with decision rights.
- **Feedback:** Information about a decision’s impact, used in the next decision.
- **FreeMarket:** A recruiting and HR structure that uses market-feedback logic.
- **Recruitment marketplace:** The FreeMarket use case in external hiring.
- **HR structure:** Roles and processes that maintain evaluation and feedback.
- **Apparent efficiency:** Metric efficiency without impact.
- **Exitability:** The ability to detach a person from the structure without operational break.
- **Scalability:** Growth of impact without linear growth in steering load.
- **System:** A whole of structure, decisions, and feedback loops.

## Model / Mechanism
If a term is used without an operational definition, decisions become interpretive → steering weakens. When terms are locked, decisions are repeatable → the feedback loop stays clear → resonance persists.

## Failure Modes
- Terms expand into metaphor, softening steering.
- New terms are added without operational definitions.
- The glossary is not used as a decision checkpoint.
- Partial application: terms are defined but do not steer decisions.

## Implementation Notes
- Start here: check every decision against glossary terms.
- Update structures if there is a conflict between terms and action.
- Train roles in decision use of terms, not philosophy.
- Use the glossary as shared language in escalation.
- Check new processes against the glossary.
- Avoid this: accept exceptions without glossary updates.
