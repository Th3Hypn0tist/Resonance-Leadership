# 05. Why people do not scale, but structures do

## Purpose
- Dismantle the illusion of people heroics and expert centrality.
- Show why competence without structure does not compound.
- Connect the individual to the system, not as its carrier.
- Justify the necessity of SXaS.

## Core Claims
- Bus factor is a structural risk, not a people risk.
- Implicit knowledge slows decision-making and blocks scale.
- Structural memory leak weakens MaxROI impact over time.
- Scalability comes from repeatability, not growing individual capacity.

## Definitions (Operational)
- **Bus factor:** How many people leaving stops the system.
- **Implicit knowledge:** Knowledge that is not available without a specific person.
- **Structural memory leak:** Repeated loss of capability during people changes.
- **Scalability:** The ability to grow impact without a proportional increase in steering load.

## Model / Mechanism
When knowledge is implicit, decisions are centralized to the expert → load grows → delay grows → impact weakens. If knowledge is converted into structure, decisions can be distributed → delay shrinks → impact grows. If Exitability improves, structural memory leak shrinks → cumulative capability grows.

## Failure Modes
- Scaling is attempted by hiring more experts without changing the structure.
- Experts receive more status, increasing dependency on them.
- Documentation is collected, but not tied to decision responsibility.
- Partial application: information is collected, but decisions stay with individuals.

## Implementation Notes
- Start here: measure bus factor for every critical process.
- Make implicit knowledge explicit only where relevant to decisions.
- Use the Exitability test regularly.
- Limit decision types to expert roles, not operational steering.
- Check where decisions bottleneck on individuals.
- Avoid this: reward heroics at the expense of structure.
