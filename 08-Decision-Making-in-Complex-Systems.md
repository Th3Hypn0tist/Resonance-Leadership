# 08. Decision-making in complex systems

## Purpose
- Shift focus from planning to decisions.
- Separate signal from noise operationally.
- Define timing and minimizing intervention.
- Describe the impact of decisions on the whole system.

## Core Claims
- A decision is the system’s steering moment; a plan is a background assumption.
- Signal is data that changes the decision; noise does not.
- Leverage arises when a small decision shifts the feedback loop.
- Irreversible decisions require the shortest feedback loop.

## Definitions (Operational)
- **Signal:** Information that changes the content or timing of a decision.
- **Noise:** Information that does not change the decision.
- **Leverage:** The impact of a decision that is disproportionately large relative to the input.
- **Irreversibility:** The impact of a decision that cannot be reversed without significant cost.

## Model / Mechanism
If a decision is made too early, signal is missing → the decision rests on an assumption → impact weakens. If a decision is made too late, the leverage opportunity passes. When the feedback loop is short and signal is recognized, the decision hits the right point → impact grows. If noise drives, the decision hits the wrong point → corrective movement grows.

## Failure Modes
- Decisions are replaced by plans and reporting.
- All data is treated as signal, slowing decisions.
- Decisions are made too early “for certainty.”
- Partial application: decisions are decentralized without defining signal.

## Implementation Notes
- Start here: define the signals a decision must satisfy.
- Bound noise: remove reports that are not used in decisions.
- Schedule decisions to the rhythm of feedback.
- Define the irreversibility class of decisions.
- Create a “no decision” rule when signal is missing.
- Avoid this: make decisions based solely on a trend.
