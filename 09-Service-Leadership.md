# 09. Service Leadership — enabling decision-making

## Purpose
- Lock Service Leadership as the only leadership form in the Resonance Leadership model.
- Define leadership as removing obstacles.
- Release responsibility to the right place.
- Separate Service Leadership from soft leadership rhetoric.

## Core Claims
- Service Leadership is maintenance of the decision-making infrastructure.
- A leader’s job is to remove structural obstacles, not make decisions for others.
- Responsibility shifts to the nearest impact point when obstacles are removed.
- If a leader owns decisions, the feedback loop lengthens.

## Definitions (Operational)
- **Service Leadership:** A leadership model where the leader maintains decision structures and removes obstacles.
- **Obstacle removal:** Actions that shorten the feedback loop or remove decision delay.
- **Leader as a servant of decision-making:** A role that ensures decisions are enabled without status-based power.

## Model / Mechanism
When a leader removes structural obstacles, decision authority moves to the impact point → the decision happens at the right time → impact grows. If a leader centralizes decisions, the decision is delayed → the feedback loop lengthens → impact weakens. Service Leadership maintains a structure where decisions happen without constant leader involvement.

## Failure Modes
- Service Leadership is interpreted as “nice leadership” without structures.
- Obstacles are removed ad hoc without structural correction.
- The leader acts as an interpreter between the team and decisions.
- Partial application: obstacles are removed, but decision responsibility stays with leadership.

## Implementation Notes
- Start here: list decision bottlenecks and their structural causes.
- Remove decision obstacles through process, not individual promises.
- Define Service Leadership responsibilities as metrics (decision delay, escalation count).
- Build escalations that do not require status.
- Link the leader’s work to the MaxROI core metrics.
- Avoid this: use the Service Leadership term without a decision structure.
