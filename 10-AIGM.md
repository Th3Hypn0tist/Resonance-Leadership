# 10. AIGM — governance without bureaucracy

## Purpose
- Introduce AIGM as a distribution model for responsibility and decision authority.
- Enable autonomy without chaos.
- Lock decision authority and responsibility together.
- Support the Service Leadership model without micromanagement.

## Core Claims
- Governance works without hierarchy if roles and escalations are in the structure.
- Responsibility before authority reduces decision delay.
- Status-based escalation slows decisions.
- AIGM is a structural model, not a bureaucratic process.

## Definitions (Operational)
- **AIGM (AI Governance Model):** A model of responsibility, decision authority, and escalation without hierarchical layers.
- **Responsibility before authority:** Decision rights follow responsibility, not position.
- **Escalation:** A predefined path that moves a decision to the next structural role.
- **Roles without hierarchy:** Roles are defined by decision type, not organizational level.

## Model / Mechanism
When roles are defined by decision type, decision authority lands at the impact point → decisions happen quickly → impact grows. If escalation is status-based, decisions are delayed → feedback weakens → corrective loops grow. AIGM keeps responsibility and decision authority in the same node, keeping the feedback loop short.

## Failure Modes
- AIGM is interpreted as a tool or process without a role structure.
- Responsibility is separated from decision authority “for safety.”
- Escalation happens through personal relationships.
- Partial application: roles are defined, but escalations are missing.

## Implementation Notes
- Start here: list decision types and their related responsibilities.
- Define decision rights through roles, not titles.
- Create an escalation diagram for each decision type.
- Test the model with decisions that have high irreversibility.
- Build decision after-feedback into role responsibility.
- Avoid this: add approval chains “just in case.”
