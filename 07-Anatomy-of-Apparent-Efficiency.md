# 07. Anatomy of apparent efficiency

## Purpose
- Reveal why busyness and metrics can lie.
- Provide criteria to identify busy work.
- Link wrong metrics to a decline in MaxROI.
- Prepare for cleaning up decision-making.

## Core Claims
- Busy work emerges when a metric measures activity rather than impact.
- Metric distortion adds noise in decision-making.
- The efficiency illusion arises when decisions are optimized locally.
- If the feedback loop provides wrong information, the system is steered off course.

## Definitions (Operational)
- **Busy work:** Work that increases activity without measurable impact on the MaxROI core metrics.
- **Metric distortion:** A metric that steers behavior away from real impact.
- **Efficiency illusion:** A state where metrics improve while impact deteriorates.

## Model / Mechanism
When a metric steers toward activity, people maximize activity → the metric improves → the decision believes impact is growing. If impact does not grow, the system starts correcting: more reporting → more busy work → impact weakens. If the metric is tied to the MaxROI core metrics, decisions steer toward impact → busy work decreases.

## Failure Modes
- Metrics are removed entirely, and steering disappears.
- Apparent efficiency is interpreted as “culture,” not structure.
- Decisions are made without impact data.
- Partial application: one metric is removed, but other distorting metrics remain.

## Implementation Notes
- Start here: identify metrics that do not correlate with the MaxROI core metrics.
- Cut reporting that does not change decisions.
- Strengthen the feedback loop: show impact before the next decision.
- Identify local optimizations (team vs. whole).
- Create a “stop list” of work that produces no impact.
- Avoid this: replace a bad metric with another without impact logic.
