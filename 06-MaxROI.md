# 06. MaxROI — Maximum Return on Intelligence

## Purpose
- Define MaxROI as a measurement system, not a leadership method.
- Lock the three core metrics: Money impact, Environmental impact, Well-being impact.
- Separate impact from work and apparent efficiency.
- Tie metrics to the cadence of decision-making.

## Core Claims
- MaxROI measures the return on intelligence as impact, not activity.
- Only three core metrics steer the whole; other metrics explain them.
- Deferred cost is an essential part of impact measurement.
- If a metric does not affect decisions, it adds noise.

## Definitions (Operational)
- **MaxROI:** A metrics framework that combines Money impact, Environmental impact, and Well-being impact.
- **Money impact:** Monetary impact as net value after the decision.
- **Environmental impact:** Impact on the environment measured as net change.
- **Well-being impact:** Impact on well-being measured as net change.
- **Deferred cost:** Impact that materializes later as a consequence of the decision.

## Model / Mechanism
If a decision grows impact in one core metric but reduces another, overall impact is contradictory. If a decision improves all three, MaxROI grows. If metrics are not visible in the decision, the decision optimizes secondary indicators → impact weakens → corrective loops grow.

## Failure Modes
- MaxROI is interpreted as personal efficiency rather than structural impact.
- Secondary metrics (e.g., velocity) steer decisions without a link to core metrics.
- Metrics are set, but deferred cost is left out.
- Partial application: only Money impact is measured.

## Implementation Notes
- Start here: define core metrics per decision type.
- Use secondary metrics only as explanatory, not steering.
- Define the evaluation horizon for deferred cost.
- Report impact per decision, not per person.
- Keep metrics visible at decision points.
- Avoid this: add metrics without updating decision logic.
