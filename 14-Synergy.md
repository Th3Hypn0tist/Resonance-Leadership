# 14. Why no part works alone

## Purpose
- Combine SXaS, MaxROI, decision-making, Service Leadership, AIGM, and FreeMarket into a single system.
- Show interdependencies and feedback loops.
- Prevent partial use and misunderstandings.
- Describe the effect of system dependence on decisions.

## Core Claims
- Every part depends on the others; a single part does not produce resonance.
- Local optimization weakens the whole.
- The feedback loop is the shared interface between SXaS, AIGM, and FreeMarket.
- MaxROI serves as the guiding impact metric for all parts.

## Definitions (Operational)
- **System dependence:** A situation where a part’s impact depends on another part’s state.
- **Local optimization:** A decision that improves one part’s metric while weakening the whole.
- **Whole:** A system where decisions, structure, and feedback are in sync.

## Model / Mechanism
If SXaS is missing, AIGM cannot withstand people changes → decision-making slows. If MaxROI does not guide, FreeMarket produces the wrong signal → HR structure distorts. When all parts are connected, feedback flows through the system → decisions target leverage points → impact grows.

## Failure Modes
- The model is split into “pillars” developed separately.
- Decision-making is optimized, but Exitability is ignored.
- MaxROI is used for reporting, not steering.
- Partial application: FreeMarket is adopted without AIGM roles.

## Implementation Notes
- Start here: draw the decision flow SXaS → AIGM → FreeMarket → MaxROI.
- Identify dependencies and define owners for connection points.
- Ensure feedback reaches all parts.
- Test the system end-to-end with one decision type.
- Remove local optimizations that do not improve the MaxROI core metrics.
- Avoid this: make any single part a “silver bullet.”
