# 11. FreeMarket — recruitment marketplace and HR structure

## Purpose
- Define FreeMarket as a recruitment marketplace, an HR tool, and a mental model.
- Describe how the same structure works in different contexts.
- Connect competence, responsibility, and feedback directly.
- Bring market feedback into HR structure.

## Core Claims
- FreeMarket works simultaneously in the applicant–employer model, the gig economy, and as an internal tool.
- Problem-based recruiting reduces prior bias and increases signal.
- Activity-based evaluation produces better decision data than CV-based evaluation.
- Fast in–out is Exitability in practice for HR.

## Definitions (Operational)
- **FreeMarket:** A structure that connects competence need, work, and feedback on a market basis.
- **Problem-based recruiting:** Evaluating a candidate through solving a concrete problem.
- **Activity-based evaluation:** Evaluation based on observed activity rather than prior assumptions.
- **Fast in–out:** A recruitment or role-change model where exit is planned in advance.

## Model / Mechanism
FreeMarket moves evaluation to real work. If the candidate solves the right problem, the signal is strong → the decision happens quickly → impact grows. If evaluation is based on prior information, the signal is weak → the decision is delayed → recruitment risk grows. Fast in–out maintains Exitability and reduces structural memory leak.

## Failure Modes
- FreeMarket is interpreted as just a recruitment tool.
- Problem-based recruiting is done without real decision authority.
- Activity-based evaluation is replaced by interviews.
- Partial application: FreeMarket is used in external searches, not internal mobility.

## Implementation Notes
- Start here: define 3–5 critical problems to recruit for.
- Build evaluation as short, real work periods.
- Define the feedback loop: decision → impact → evaluation.
- Keep Exitability visible: leaving the role is part of the agreement.
- Use the same structure for internal role changes.
- Avoid this: turn FreeMarket into more bureaucracy.
