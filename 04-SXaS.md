# 04. SXaS — Structure as a Service

## Purpose
- Define the “Structure before tools” principle in practical terms.
- Describe the role of ownership and Exitability in resonance.
- Create a structure that withstands people changes.
- Connect structure to scalability without people risk.

## Core Claims
- Tools do not scale without structural ownership.
- Exitability is a structural durability metric, not a people issue.
- Structures can be provided as services just as standardized as technical services.
- Without SXaS, resonance breaks because the feedback loop is interrupted by people changes.

## Definitions (Operational)
- **SXaS (Structure as a Service):** A structure that is documented, owned, and transferable from role to role without interruption.
- **Ownership:** A clear accountable party for maintaining and improving the structure.
- **Exitability:** The ability to detach a person from a process without breaking operations.
- **Structural durability:** The system’s ability to preserve operation despite changes.

## Model / Mechanism
When structure is a service, its owner ensures continuous maintenance. If the structure has Ownership and Exitability, a person’s departure does not break feedback → decision-making continues → resonance persists. If the structure depends on individuals, turnover breaks the feedback loop → decisions slow → impact weakens.

## Failure Modes
- SXaS is interpreted as documentation without an owner.
- Exitability is treated as an HR issue, not a structural requirement.
- Tools are swapped, but the structure remains person-dependent.
- Partial application: a process is owned, but decision authority is not.

## Implementation Notes
- Start here: select 2–3 critical structures and name an owner.
- Describe the structure so a new role can operate within 1 week.
- Define Exitability tests (e.g., 2-week absence).
- Connect structure metrics to the MaxROI core metrics.
- Ensure decision rights travel with the structure.
- Avoid this: build SXaS without feedback from real use cases.
