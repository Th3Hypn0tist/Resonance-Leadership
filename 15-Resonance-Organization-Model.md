# 15. Resonance organization model

## Purpose
- Provide an overall picture of a functioning resonance organization.
- Enable application in different contexts.
- Serve as a practical reference model and starting point for implementations.
- Lock structures and feedback loops together.

## Core Claims
- A resonance organization is a structure, not an org chart.
- The reference model is adaptable, but not partially editable.
- The connection between decision-making, SXaS, and AIGM defines system stability.
- FreeMarket serves as both external and internal signal sources.

## Definitions (Operational)
- **Resonance organization:** An organization whose decision-making and structure are connected to a feedback loop.
- **Reference architecture:** A base model applied across environments.
- **Applicability:** The ability to adapt the model to context without breaking its feedback loops.

## Model / Mechanism
In a resonance organization, decision types steer roles (AIGM) and structures (SXaS). If a decision follows the defined escalation, the feedback loop stays short → impact grows. If the model is broken apart, feedback does not flow → decisions detach from impact → the system weakens.

## Failure Modes
- The reference architecture is copied without context signal.
- The structure is designed, but operational decision-making is left unchanged.
- FreeMarket is left only on the outer edge of recruiting.
- Partial application: Service Leadership is defined, but AIGM is missing.

## Implementation Notes
- Start here: map decision types and their impact points.
- Build SXaS for critical processes before changing tools.
- Strengthen AIGM escalations and roles.
- Connect FreeMarket to internal mobility.
- Make the MaxROI core metrics visible in decision-making.
- Avoid this: build the model as “strategy” without operational decision-making.
