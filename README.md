# Resonance Leadership — structure, decision-making, and market feedback in one system

Resonance Leadership defines leadership as an operational structure where decisions and feedback are in sync and the MaxROI core metrics steer impact.

## What problem this solves
- Leadership structures are detached from real impact.
- KPI and SaaS optimization produces the apparent-efficiency phenomenon.
- Decision-making is slow because feedback arrives late.
- HR and governance evaluate people, not structures.

## What you get after reading
- A clear model where decision-making, structure, and feedback connect.
- Operational definitions that make decisions repeatable.
- A structure that preserves Exitability and reduces people risk.
- Practical checklists for building resonance.

## How to read (recommended order)
- Read chapters in order 1–17.
- Note decision types and their impact points in your notes.
- Return to the glossary whenever you encounter a contradiction.
