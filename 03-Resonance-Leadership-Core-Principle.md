# 03. Resonance Leadership — the core principle

## Purpose
- Define Resonance Leadership precisely as an operating system.
- Separate the model from leadership styles and culture talk.
- Lock the thesis: leadership = tuning structure and decision-making.
- Define what Resonance Leadership is not.

## Core Claims
- Leadership is system steering, not personal influence.
- Resonance Leadership works only if decision authority is coupled with feedback.
- Structure quality determines decision quality more than individual capability.
- Resonance Leadership is not a motivation model or a culture framework.

## Definitions (Operational)
- **Resonance Leadership:** A structure and decision model where the feedback loop is short and decisions target leverage points.
- **Leadership as structure:** The explicit arrangement of authority, responsibility, and feedback.
- **Releasing responsibility:** Moving responsibility to the closest impact point with clear escalations.

## Model / Mechanism
Resonance Leadership builds a decision structure where responsibility and feedback live in the same place. If decision authority and impact meet, decisions hit leverage points → impact grows → the system stabilizes. If decision authority is far from impact, feedback arrives late → decisions miss → corrective movement grows.

## Failure Modes
- The model is confused with charismatic leadership.
- The structure is written down but not used in decisions.
- Responsibility and decision authority are separated.
- Partial application: decisions are decentralized without shared feedback rules.

## Implementation Notes
- Start here: list decision types and their nearest impact points.
- Define decision-making per role, not per person.
- Document the feedback loop for every decision.
- Identify irreversible decisions and shorten their delay.
- Ensure escalation is structural, not status-based.
- Avoid this: mix leadership training programs with structural change.
