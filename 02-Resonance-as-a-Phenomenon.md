# 02. Resonance as a phenomenon (not a metaphor)

## Purpose
- Anchor resonance in systems theory, not culture talk.
- Define resonance as timing, amplification, and feedback.
- Separate resonance from inspirational rhetoric.
- Create the technical foundation for the Resonance Leadership model.

## Core Claims
- Resonance emerges when a system input matches the rhythm of its feedback.
- Feedback can amplify or dampen depending on phase alignment.
- Linear steering fails in nonlinear systems without tuning the feedback loop.
- Resonance is a measurable phenomenon: it appears as amplified impact with small input.

## Definitions (Operational)
- **Feedback:** A feedback loop that carries impact back into decision-making.
- **Phase alignment:** The timing relationship between input and feedback.
- **Amplification vs. damping:** The effect of feedback on system behavior (increasing or decreasing impact).
- **Nonlinear system:** A system in which a small change can yield a large impact or no impact at all.

## Model / Mechanism
Resonance occurs when the rhythm of decisions matches the system's feedback rhythm. If input arrives at the right phase, impact amplifies. If input arrives at the wrong phase, impact dampens. If the feedback loop is too slow, the decision is based on an old state → impact hits the wrong phase → the system dampens.

## Failure Modes
- Resonance is confused with “good vibes” rather than measurable impact.
- Steering uses linear assumptions in a nonlinear environment.
- Feedback is collected but not scheduled to the rhythm of decision-making.
- Partial application: feedback channels are added, but decision rhythm stays unchanged.

## Implementation Notes
- Start here: define the system’s natural feedback delay (day, week, sprint).
- Fit the decision cadence to the feedback cadence.
- Measure amplification: impact per input.
- Identify where impact flips into damping.
- Remove feedback channels that are not used in decisions.
- Avoid this: add data without changing the decision schedule.
