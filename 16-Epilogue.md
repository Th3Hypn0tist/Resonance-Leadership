# 16. Less leadership. More impact.

## Purpose
- Condense the book into a single core sentence.
- Shift focus from beliefs to action.
- Close the model for operational use.

## Core Claims
- Less leadership means less decision delay, not less responsibility.
- More impact emerges when structure steers decisions to leverage points.
- The feedback loop is more important than the plan.
- Resonance Leadership is continuous tuning, not a one-off project.

## Definitions (Operational)
- **Less leadership:** Decentralizing decision authority through structure.
- **More impact:** Measurable change in the MaxROI core metrics.
- **Continuous tuning:** Iterating structure based on feedback.

## Model / Mechanism
When leadership moves into structures, decisions happen close to impact → feedback shortens → impact grows. If leadership concentrates, decisions are delayed → feedback loop lengthens → impact weakens. Continuous tuning sustains resonance in a changing environment.

## Failure Modes
- The epilogue is interpreted as a promise rather than an action directive.
- Change is seen as a project, not structural tuning.
- The feedback loop is ignored because “the direction is right.”
- Partial application: decisions are decentralized without metrics.

## Implementation Notes
- Start here: pick one decision type and shorten its feedback loop.
- Define what “impact” means in the MaxROI core metrics.
- Keep decision delay visible to the leadership team.
- Set a monthly structural tuning cycle.
- Publish a clear stop list for decisions that do not produce impact.
- Avoid this: add visionary talk without structural change.
