# 13. Why the market does not punish, but filters

## Purpose
- Describe the market as a neutral feedback mechanism.
- Show how functioning structures strengthen and weak ones fall away.
- Close the system’s external feedback loop.
- Connect market feedback to internal steering.

## Core Claims
- The market acts as selection, not a moral judge.
- The delay of reality feedback defines how fast the structure learns.
- Structural learning happens when feedback changes the structure, not just decisions.
- Internal and external feedback must be combined to sustain resonance.

## Definitions (Operational)
- **Selection:** A mechanism that preserves functioning structures and removes weak ones.
- **Reality feedback delay:** The time from decision to visible market impact.
- **Structural learning:** Change in structure based on feedback.

## Model / Mechanism
If market feedback is slow, decisions rely on internal data → risk grows. When external feedback is considered, decision quality improves → the structure adapts → MaxROI grows. If market feedback is ignored, the system optimizes internal metrics → impact weakens.

## Failure Modes
- The market is interpreted as punishment, increasing defensive reactions.
- Feedback is seen as random, so the structure does not change.
- Internal metrics are separated from market impact.
- Partial application: market feedback is used only in strategic decisions, not operational ones.

## Implementation Notes
- Start here: define where market feedback shows up first.
- Shorten the delay: build fast experiments and feedback channels.
- Change the structure when feedback repeats.
- Separate market feedback from single events.
- Tie market feedback to the MaxROI core metrics.
- Avoid this: explain away feedback without structural analysis.
